      <h1>Pantasya Playground</h1>



hello world!<br><br> 

I am Gerald Q. Cruz a BSCS student your fellow playmate started the first online pantasya playground at Thursday, September 1, 2022.<br><br> 

I am an AMAER at AMA binan.<br><br>

Thursday, September 1, 2022<br><br> 
this is the day that my gf says yes to me<br><br>

Pantasya Playground is my gift to her.<br><br>

I started teaching in HS in a computer shop.<br><br>

Im borrowing books from college students when they rent at the shop, note no internet that days and Im making their Machine Problems for exchange that I can program computers for free.<br><br>
I am a game developer i make my own games.<br><br>

I like playing games in an emulator NES, SNES, GameBoy, GameBoyAdvance, PSP, etc.<br><br>

I made pantasya playground free.<br><br>

Mt10:8 Freely recieved, Freely Give.<br><br>

Pantasya is a bible based school.<br><br>
We follow the teachings of Jesus Christ and believe that the bible is the words of GOD. Do good and good will comeback to you multiple times.<br><br>

The goal of pantasya is to teach a student to make and manage a pantasya playground in everywhere possible.<br><br>

A pantasya playground is a place online or a physical place where playmates gather to study, work and play peacefully.<br><br>

Anyone can teach anything in a pantasya playground.<br><br>

We don't compete we cooperate.<br><br>

I made the first online pantasya playground using only a mobile phone with termux linux and an internet connection then I started teaching Computer Programming Online.<br><br> 

You can do it too with the help of Jehovah our GOD.<br><br>

Be a Pantasya Playmate now and let us build Pantasya Playgrounds everywhere possible.<br><br>

may Jehovah GOD bless you. Amen.<br><br>

1 Timoteo 4:16 (NWT) Pay constant attention to yourself and to your teaching. Persevere in these things, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.<br><br>
